## Description

DISCLAIMER: The ADD EMPLOYEE and UPDATE EMPLOYEE are broken and will not work.

This app is supposed to keep track of employees in the work place. The current iteration of this app can only view employees that are already in a database. Future updates will allow for users to add and update employee information

This app was to get practice using MySQL database in node interface

I learned how to join tables using query strings in JavaScript
